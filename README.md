## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project reinforced the major concepts of web development using vanilla javascript, CSS and HTML. CSS Grid and Flexbox featured heavily in this design, and using them has taught me many more tips and tricks in getting designs done. Having to problem solve and come up with solutions, especially using Javascript was a very rewarding experience.

Above all, working on this priject has made me more confident as a web developer as well as put the foundational concepts of HTML, CSS, and Javascript at my fingertips. I look forward to deepening my knowledge, broadening my horizon, and taking on more challenging designs after this one. Also, I look forward to mastering a frontend development framework like REACT so as to greatly increase my efficiency.

### Continued development

Creating this design from scratch with nothing but the design assets and getting it perfectly has been a huge morale boost for me. As such, more than ever, I am ctrongly driven to continue my development as a web developer. My next major project would be to create an even more complex design that will push my coding skills to the limit. I also hope to master REACT soon and begin to use it to create even greater projects.
